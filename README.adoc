= Neo4j - Tableau Integration

== Neo4j Tableau Web Data Connector

Tableau 9.1 includes the Web Data Connector SDK, which lets you connect to any web data accessible over HTTP. You can follow the WDC Tutorial to read about the details: http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/wdc/en-us/help.htm

The WDC for Neo4j consists of a HTML page including a form and JavaScript code to leverage the Tableau WDC API and to process Cypher queries against Neo4j Transactional HTTP API via Ajax call. 
The JSON result set will be converted into a table and then passed into the Tableau workbook. 

The Web Data Connector requires a hosted HTML page to pass the query to Neo4j and return the results directly to Tableau using JavaScript.

We also provide this as an hosted version on GitHub as GitHub pages.

=== Connect from Tableau

Start Tableau Desktop and choose to connect a WDC (Web Data Connector):

image::documentation/img/image003.png[width=300]

Enter the URL of your hosted Neo4jWdc.html page in the selection popup.

Now the Neo4jWdc Form appears.

Enter the required details, the Cypher Query and optional choose result set type.

After query execution the created and loaded *Tableau Workbook* will appear and shows the data source or extract: *Neo4j*, the name weâ€™ve entered, and the dimensions and measures from the Cypher query result set.

Now we can easily start analyzing the Data from Neo4j:

*The link:./documentation/neo4j-tableau-web-data-connector.adoc[documentation] details installation, usage and configuration of the Web Data Connector.*

=== TDE File Generator Extension

We also provide a Neo4j Server extension to generate TDE files to be used with Tableau Desktop and Server.

*Read more about that approach in link:./documentation/tde-file-generation.adoc[our documentation].*

To create a TDE from the results of a Neo4j Cypher query, pass for instance the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Movie) RETURN n
----

To this URL: `http://localhost:7474/export/tableau/tde/MATCH+(n%3AMovie)+RETURN+n`

It will generate and return a TDE file for usage in Tableau.

== Versions

* This code has been tested on Neo4j 3.0 versions. 
* This code has been tested against Tableau 9.1.
* The TDE format should be able to be read by Tableau versions 7 and higher.
